# Topics to Keep an Eye on

## 5G and Media

5G new radio and systems technologies provide new functionalities for video distribution. 5G targets not only smartphones, but also new devices such as augmented reality glasses or automotive receivers. Higher bandwidth, lower latencies, edge and cloud computing functionalities, service-based architectures, low power consumption, broadcast/multicast functionalities and other network functions come hand in hand with new media formats and processing capabilities promising better and more consistent quality for traditional video streaming services as well as enabling new experiences such as immersive media and augmented realities.

## Ad Insertion

Ads can be inserted at different stages in the streaming workflow, on the server side or client side. The DASH-IF guidelines detail server-side ad-insertion with period replacements based on manipulating the manifest. HLS interstitials provide a similar approach. The idea is that the manifest can be changed and point to a sub-playlist of segments, possibly located on a different location. This approach results in efficient resource usage in the network, as duplicate caching is avoided, but some intelligence at the player is needed to deal with content transitions (e.g., codec changes, timeline gaps, etc.). Player support for such content is gradually maturing. Other important technologies for ad insertion include signalling of ads and breaks that is still typically based on SCTE-35 for HLS and SCTE-214 for DASH. Such signals provide useful information for scheduling the ads and contacting ad servers. The usage of SCTE-35 for ad insertion is popular in the broadcast industry, while the exact usage in the OTT space is still being discussed in SCTE. Another important technology is identification of ads, such as based on ad-id or other commercial entities that provide such services. The identification of the ad in a manifest or stream is usually standardized by SMPTE. Other key technologies for ad insertion include tracking of viewer impressions, usually based on Video Ad Serving Template (VAST) defined by IAB.

## Contribution and Ingest

There are different contribution and ingest specifications dealing with different use cases. A common case is contribution that previously happened over satellite to a broadcast or streaming headend. RIST and SRT are examples of such contribution protocols. Within a streaming headend the encoder and packager/CDN may have an ingest/contribution interface as well. This is specified by the DASH-IF Ingest.

- RIST: <https://www.rist.tv/>
- SRT: <https://github.com/Haivision/srt>

## Synchronized Encoding and Packaging

Practical streaming headends need redundant encoders and packagers to operate without glitches and blackouts. The redundant operation requires synchronization between two or more encoders and also between two or more packagers that possibly handle different inputs and outputs, generating compatible inter-changeable output representations. This problem is important for anyone developing a streaming headend at scale, and the synchronization problem is currently under discussion in the wider community.

## WebRTC-Based Streaming

WebRTC is increasingly being used for streaming of time-sensitive content such as live sporting events. Innovations in cloud computing allow implementers to efficiently scale delivery of content using WebRTC. Support for WebRTC communication is available on all modern web browsers and is available on native clients for all major platforms.
