that pertain to quality of experience in delivery of video and other
high-bitrate media over the internet.

#Introduction {#intro}

As the internet has grown, an increasingly large share of the traffic
delivered to end users has become video.  Estimates
put the total share of internet video traffic at 75% in 2019, expected
to grow to 82% by 2022.  What's more, this estimate projects the
gross volume of video traffic will more than double during this time,
based on a compound annual growth rate continuing at 34% (from Appendix
D of {{CVNI}}).

In many contexts, video traffic can be handled transparently as
generic application-level traffic.  However, as the volume of
video traffic continues to grow, it's becoming increasingly
important to consider the effects of network design decisions
on application-level performance, with considerations for
the impact on video delivery.

This document aims to provide a taxonomy of networking issues as
they relate to quality of experience in internet video delivery.
The focus is on capturing characteristics of video delivery that
have surprised network designers or transport experts without
specific video expertise, since these highlight key differences
between common assumptions in existing networking documents and
observations of video delivery issues in practice.

Making specific recommendations for mitigating these issues
is out of scope, though some existing mitigations are mentioned
in passing.  The intent is to provide a point of reference for
future solution proposals to use in describing how new
technologies address or avoid these existing observed problems.

#Bandwidth Provisioning

##Scaling Requirements for Media Delivery {#scaling}

###Video Bitrates

Video bitrate selection depends on many variables.  Different
providers give different guidelines, but an equation that
approximately matches the bandwidth requirement estimates
from several video providers is given in {{MSOD}}:

~~~
Kbps = (HEIGHT * WIDTH * FRAME_RATE) / (15 * 1024)
~~~

Height and width are in pixels, and frame rate is in frames per second.
The actual bitrate required for a specific video will also depend on the
codec used, fidelity desired and some other characteristics of the video itself, such
as the amount and frequency of high-detail motion, which may influence the
compressability of the content, but this equation provides a rough
estimate.

Here are a few common resolutions used for video content, with their
typical per-user bandwidth requirements according to this formula:

| Name | Width x Height | Approximate Bitrate for 60fps
| -----+----------------+-------------------------------
| DVD |  720 x 480 | 1.3 Mbps
| 720p (1K) | 1280 x 720 | 3.6 Mbps
| 1080p (2K) | 1920 x 1080 | 8.1 Mbps
| 2160p (4k) | 3840 x 2160 | 32 Mbps

###Virtual Reality Bitrates

Even the basic virtual reality (360-degree) videos (that allow users to look around freely, referred to as three degrees of freedom - 3DoF) require substantially larger bitrates when they are captured and encoded as such videos require multiple fields of view of the scene. The typical multiplication factor is 8 to 10. Yet, due to smart delivery methods such as viewport-based or tiled-based streaming, we do not need to send the whole scene to the user. Instead, the user needs only the portion corresponding to its viewpoint at any given time. 

In more immersive applications, where basic user movement (3DoF+) or full user movement (6DoF) is allowed, the required bitrate grows even further. In this case, the immersive content is typically referred to as volumetric media. One way to represent the volumetric media is to use point clouds, where streaming a single object may easily require a bitrate of 30 Mbps or higher. Refer to {{PCC}} for more details.  


##Path Requirements

The bitrate requirements in {{scaling}} are per end-user actively
consuming a media feed, so in the worst case, the bitrate demands
can be multiplied by the number of simultaneous users to find the
bandwidth requirements for a router on the delivery path with that
number of users downstream.  For example, at a node with 10,000
downstream users simultaneously consuming video streams,
approximately up to 80 Gbps would be necessary in order for all
of them to get 1080p resolution at 60 fps.

However, when there is some overlap in the feeds being consumed by
end users, it is sometimes possible to reduce the bandwidth
provisioning requirements for the network by performing some kind
of replication within the network.  This can be achieved via object
caching with delivery of replicated objects over individual
connections, and/or by packet-level replication using multicast.

To the extent that replication of popular content can be performed,
bandwidth requirements at peering or ingest points can be reduced to
as low as a per-feed requirement instead of a per-user requirement.

##Caching Systems

TBD: pros, cons, tradeoffs of caching designs at different locations within
the network?

Peak vs. average provisioning, and effects on peering point congestion
under peak load?

Provisioning issues for caching systems?

## Personalization and Advertizing

Some of this fits better under adaptive bitrate, but most of it seems
to tie to caching and bandwidth.  Maybe refactor or move as the other
sections are developed.

A simple model of video playback can be described as a video stream
consumer, a buffer, and a transport mechanism that fills the buffer.
The consumption rate is fairly static and is represented by the
content bitrate.  The size of the buffer is also commonly a fixed
size.  The fill process needs to be at least fast enough to ensure
that the buffer is never empty, however it also can have significant
complexity when things like personalization or ad workflows are
introduced.

The challenges in filling the buffer in a timely way fall into two
broad categories: 1. content selection and 2. content variation.
Content selection comprises all of the steps needed to determine which
content variation to offer the client.  Content variation is the
number of content options that exist at any given selection point.  A
common example easily visualized is Adaptive Bitrate, described in
more detail below.  The mechanism used to select the bitrate is part
of the content selection, and the content variation are all of the
different bitrate renditions.

A similar but more complex case is the use of an ad selection service
to choose ad segments during video playback.  The ad selection service
needs to process the requests in a timely way so that video service
isn't interrupted.  This time to respond is added to the normal time
spent requesting the video assets themselves.  In general, the more
targeted the ad request is, the more requests the ad service needs to
be able to handle concurrently.  If connectivity is poor to the ad
service, this can cause rebuffering even if the underlying video
assets (both content and ads) are able to be accessed quickly.  The
less targeted, the more likely the ad requests can be consolidated and
can leverage the same caching techniques as the video content.

## DNS

TBD: More unique hostnames means more lookups and potential delays.

##Predictable Usage Profiles

Historical data shows that users consume more video and videos at higher bitrates than they did in the past on their connected devices. Improvements in the codecs that help with reducing the encoding bitrates with better compression algorithms could not have offset the increase in the demand for the higher quality video (higher resolution, higher frame rate, better color gamut, better dynamic range, etc.). In particular, mobile data usage has shown a large jump over the years due to increased consumption of entertainement as well as conversational video.

TBD: insert charts showing historical relative data usage patterns with
error bars by time of day in consumer networks?

Cross-ref vs. video quality by time of day in practice for some case
study?  Not sure if there's a good way to capture a generalized insight
here, but it seems worth making the point that demand projections can
be used to help with e.g. power consumption with routing architectures
that provide for modular scalability.

##Unpredictable Usage Profiles

Although TCP/IP has been used with a number of widely used applications that have symmetric bandwidth requirements (similar bandwidth requirements in each direction between endpoints), many widely-used Internet applications operate in client-server roles, with asymmetric bandwidth requirements. A common example might be an HTTP GET operation, where a client sends a relatively small HTTP GET request for a resource to an HTTP server, and often receives a significantly larger response carrying the requested resource. When HTTP is commonly used to stream movie-length video, the ratio between response size and request size can become quite large. 

For this reason, operators may pay more attention to downstream bandwidth utilization when planning and managing capacity. In addition, operators have been able to deploy access networks for end users using underlying technologies that are inherently asymetric, favoring downstream bandwidth (e.g. ADSL, cellular technologies, most IEEE 802.11 variants), assuming that users will need less upstream bandwidth than downstream bandwidth. This strategy usually works, except when it does not, because application bandwidth usage patterns have changed. 

One example of this type of change was when peer-to-peer file sharing applications gained popularity in the early 2000s. To take one well-documented case ({{RFC5594}}), the Bittorrent application created "swarms" of hosts, uploading and downloading files to each other, rather than communicating with a server. Bittorrent favored peers who uploaded as much as they downloaded, so that new Bittorrent users had an incentive to significantly increase their upstream bandwidth utilization. 

The combination of the large volume of "torrents" and the peer-to-peer characteristic of swarm transfers meant that end user hosts were suddenly uploading higher volumes of traffic to more destinations than was the case before Bittorrent. This caused at least one large ISP to attempt to "throttle" these transfers, to mitigate the load that these hosts placed on their network. These efforts were met by increased use of encryption in Bittorrent, similar to an arms race, and set off discussions about "Net Neutrality" and calls for regulatory action.

Especially as end users increase use of video-based social networking applications, it will be helpful for access network providers to watch for increasing numbers of end users uploading significant amounts of content. 

#Adaptive Bitrate

##Overview

Adaptive BitRate (ABR) is a sort of application-level
response strategy in which the receiving media player attempts to
detect the available bandwidth of the network path by experiment
or by observing the successful application-layer download speed,
then chooses a video bitrate (among the limited number of available options) that fits within that bandwidth,
typically adjusting as changes in available bandwidth occur in
the network or changes in capabilities occur in the player (such as available memory, CPU, display size, etc.).

The choice of bitrate occurs within the context of optimizing for
some metric monitored by the video player, such as highest achievable
video quality, or lowest rate of expected rebuffering events.

##Segmented Delivery

ABR playback is commonly implemented by video players using HLS
{{RFC8216}} or DASH {{DASH}} to perform a reliable segmented delivery
of video data over HTTP. Different player implementations and
receiving devices use different strategies, often proprietary
algorithms (called rate adaptation or bitrate selection algorithms), to perform available
bandwidth estimation/prediction and the bitrate selection. Most players only use passive observations, i.e., they do not generate probe traffic to measure the available bandwidth. 

This kind of bandwidth-measurement systems can experience trouble in
several ways that can be affected by networking design choices.

###Idle Time between Segments

When the bitrate selection is successfully chosen below the
available capacity of the network path, the response to a
segment request will typically complete in less absolute time than the
duration of the requested segment. The resulting idle time within the connection carrying the
segments has a few surprising consequences:

 * Mobile flow-bandwidth spectrum and timing mapping.

 * TCP slow-start when restarting after idle requires multiple
   RTTs to re-establish a throughput at the network's available
   capacity. On high-RTT paths or with small enough segments,
   this can produce a falsely low application-visible measurement
   of the available network capacity.

A detailed investigation of this phenomenon is available in {{NOSSDAV12}}.

###Head-of-Line Blocking

In the event of a lost packet on a TCP connection with SACK
support (a common case for segmented delivery in practice), loss
of a packet can provide a confusing bandwidth signal to the
receiving application.  Because of the sliding window in TCP,
many packets may be accepted by the receiver without being available
to the application until the missing packet arrives.  Upon arrival
of the one missing packet after retransmit, the receiver will
suddenly get access to a lot of data at the same time.

To a receiver measuring bytes received per unit time at the
application layer, and interpreting it as an estimate of the
available network bandwidth, this appears as a high jitter in
the goodput measurement.

Active Queue Management (AQM) systems such as PIE {{RFC8033}} or
variants of RED {{RFC2309}} that induce early random loss under
congestion can mitigate this by using ECN {{RFC3168}} where
available.  ECN provides a congestion signal and induce a similar
backoff in flows that use Explicit Congestion Notification-capable
transport, but by avoiding loss avoids inducing head-of-line blocking
effects in TCP connections.

##Unreliable Transport

In contrast to segmented delivery, several applications use UDP or
unreliable SCTP to deliver RTP or raw TS-formatted video.

Under congestion and loss, this approach generally experiences more
video artifacts with fewer delay or head-of-line blocking effects.
Often one of the key goals is to reduce latency, to better support
applications like videoconferencing, or for other live-action
video with interactive components, such as some sporting events.

Congestion avoidance strategies for this kind of deployment vary
widely in practice, ranging from some streams that are entirely
unresponsive to using feedback signaling to change encoder settings
(as in {{RFC5762}}), or to use fewer enhancement layers (as in
{{RFC6190}}), to proprietary methods for detecting quality of
experience issues and cutting off video.

# Doc History and Side Notes

Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication

TBD: suggestion from mic at IETF 106 (Mark Nottingham): dive into
the different constraints coming from different parts of the network
or distribution channels. (regarding questions about how to describe
the disconnect between demand vs. capacity, while keeping good archival
value.)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_k340xT2jM&t=13m

TBD: suggestion from mic at IETF 106 (Dave Oran + Glenn Deen responding):
pre-placement for many use cases is useful--distinguish between live vs.
cacheable.  "People assume high-demand == live, but not always true" with
popular netflix example.

(Glenn): something about latency requirements for cached vs. streaming on
live vs.  pre-recorded content, and breaking requirements into 2 separate
charts.  also: "Standardized ladder" for adaptive bit rate rates suggested,
declined as out of scope.

TBD: suggestion at the mic from IETF 106 (Aaron Falk): include
industry standard metrics from citations, some standard scoping metrics
may be already defined.
