Internet-Draft             Media Streaming Ops                  May 2021


1.  Introduction

   As the internet has grown, an increasingly large share of the traffic
   delivered to end users has become video.  Estimates put the total
   share of internet video traffic at 75% in 2019, expected to grow to
   82% by 2022.  What's more, this estimate projects the gross volume of
   video traffic will more than double during this time, based on a
   compound annual growth rate continuing at 34% (from Appendix D of
   [CVNI]).

   A substantial part of this growth is due to increased use of
   streaming video, although the amount of video traffic in real-time
   communications (for example, online videoconferencing) has also grown
   significantly.  While both streaming video and videoconferencing have
   real-time delivery and latency requirements, these requirements vary
   from one application to another.  For example, videoconferencing
   demands an end-to-end (one-way) latency of a few hundreds of
   milliseconds whereas live streaming can tolerate latencies of several
   seconds.

   This document specifically focuses on the streaming applications and
   defines streaming as follows: Streaming is transmission of a
   continuous media from a server to a client and its simultaneous
   consumption by the client.  Here, continous media refers to media and
   associated streams such as video, audio, metadata, etc.  In this
   definition, the critical term is "simultaneous", as it is not
   considered streaming if one downloads a video file and plays it after
   the download is completed, which would be called download-and-play.
   This has two implications.  First, server's transmission rate must
   (loosely or tightly) match to client's consumption rate for an
   uninterrupted playback.  That is, the client must not run out of data
   (buffer underrun) or take more than it can keep (buffer overrun) as
   any excess media is simply discarded.  Second, client's consumption
   rate is limited by not only bandwidth availability but also the real-
   time constraints.  That is, the client cannot fetch media that is not
   available yet.

   In many contexts, video traffic can be handled transparently as
   generic application-level traffic.  However, as the volume of video
   traffic continues to grow, it's becoming increasingly important to
   consider the effects of network design decisions on application-level
   performance, with considerations for the impact on video delivery.

   This document aims to provide a taxonomy of networking issues as they
   relate to quality of experience in internet video delivery.  The
   focus is on capturing characteristics of video delivery that have
   surprised network designers or transport experts without specific
   video expertise, since these highlight key differences between common
   assumptions in existing networking documents and observations of
   video delivery issues in practice.

   Making specific recommendations for mitigating these issues is out of
   scope, though some existing mitigations are mentioned in passing.
   The intent is to provide a point of reference for future solution
   proposals to use in describing how new technologies address or avoid
   these existing observed problems.

2.  Bandwidth Provisioning

2.1.  Scaling Requirements for Media Delivery

2.1.1.  Video Bitrates

   Video bitrate selection depends on many variables.  Different
   providers give different guidelines, but an equation that
   approximately matches the bandwidth requirement estimates from
   several video providers is given in [MSOD]:

   Kbps = (HEIGHT * WIDTH * FRAME_RATE) / (MOTION_FACTOR * 1024)

   Height and width are in pixels, frame rate is in frames per second,
   and the motion factor is a value that ranges from 20 for a low-motion
   talking heads video to 7 for sports, and content with a lot of screen
   changes.

   The motion factor captures the variability in bitrate due to the
   amount and frequency of high-detail motion, which generally
   influences the compressability of the content.

   The exact bitrate required for a particular video also depends on a
   number of specifics about the codec used and how the codec-specific
   tuning parameters are matched to the content, but this equation
   provides a rough estimate that approximates the usual bitrate
   characteristics using the most common codecs and settings for
   production traffic.

   Here are a few common resolutions used for video content, with their
   typical and peak per-user bandwidth requirements for 60 frames per
   second (FPS):

                                 Table 1

2.1.2.  Virtual Reality Bitrates

   Even the basic virtual reality (360-degree) videos (that allow users
   to look around freely, referred to as three degrees of freedom -
   3DoF) require substantially larger bitrates when they are captured
   and encoded as such videos require multiple fields of view of the
   scene.  The typical multiplication factor is 8 to 10.  Yet, due to
   smart delivery methods such as viewport-based or tiled-based
   streaming, we do not need to send the whole scene to the user.
   Instead, the user needs only the portion corresponding to its
   viewpoint at any given time.

   In more immersive applications, where basic user movement (3DoF+) or
   full user movement (6DoF) is allowed, the required bitrate grows even
   further.  In this case, the immersive content is typically referred
   to as volumetric media.  One way to represent the volumetric media is
   to use point clouds, where streaming a single object may easily
   require a bitrate of 30 Mbps or higher.  Refer to [MPEGI] and [PCC]
   for more details.

2.2.  Path Requirements

   The bitrate requirements in Section 2.1 are per end-user actively
   consuming a media feed, so in the worst case, the bitrate demands can
   be multiplied by the number of simultaneous users to find the
   bandwidth requirements for a router on the delivery path with that
   number of users downstream.  For example, at a node with 10,000
   downstream users simultaneously consuming video streams,
   approximately 80 Gbps would be necessary in order for all of them to
   get typical content at 1080p resolution at 60 fps, or up to 180 Gbps
   to get sustained high-motion content such as sports, while
   maintaining the same resolution.

Internet-Draft             Media Streaming Ops                  May 2021


   However, when there is some overlap in the feeds being consumed by
   end users, it is sometimes possible to reduce the bandwidth
   provisioning requirements for the network by performing some kind of
   replication within the network.  This can be achieved via object
   caching with delivery of replicated objects over individual
   connections, and/or by packet-level replication using multicast.

   To the extent that replication of popular content can be performed,
   bandwidth requirements at peering or ingest points can be reduced to
   as low as a per-feed requirement instead of a per-user requirement.

2.3.  Caching Systems

   When demand for content is relatively predictable, and especially
   when that content is relatively static, caching content close to
   requesters, and pre-loading caches to respond quickly to initial
   requests, is often useful (for example, HTTP/1.1 caching is described
   in [RFC7234]).  This is subject to the usual considerations for
   caching - for example, how much data must be cached to make a
   significant difference to the requester, and how the benefits of
   caching and pre-loading caches balances against the costs of tracking
   "stale" content in caches and refreshing that content.

   It is worth noting that not all high-demand content is also "live"
   content.  One popular example is when popular streaming content can
   be staged close to a significant number of requesters, as can happen
   when a new episode of a popular show is released.  This content may
   be largely stable, so low-cost to maintain in multiple places
   throughout the Internet.  This can reduce demands for high end-to-end
   bandwidth without having to use mechanisms like multicast.

   Caching and pre-loading can also reduce exposure to peering point
   congestion, since less traffic crosses the peering point exchanges if
   the caches are placed in peer networks, and could be pre-loaded
   during off-peak hours, using "Lower-Effort Per-Hop Behavior (LE PHB)
   for Differentiated Services" [RFC8622], "Low Extra Delay Background
   Transport (LEDBAT)" [RFC6817], or similar mechanisms.

   All of this depends, of course, on the ability of a content provider
   to predict usage and provision bandwidth, caching, and other
   mechanisms to meet the needs of users.  In some cases (Section 2.4),
   this is relatively routine, but in other cases, it is more difficult
   (Section 2.5, Section 2.6).

2.4.  Predictable Usage Profiles

   Historical data shows that users consume more video and videos at
   higher bitrates than they did in the past on their connected devices.
   Improvements in the codecs that help with reducing the encoding
   bitrates with better compression algorithms could not have offset the
   increase in the demand for the higher quality video (higher
   resolution, higher frame rate, better color gamut, better dynamic
   range, etc.).  In particular, mobile data usage has shown a large
   jump over the years due to increased consumption of entertainement as
   well as conversational video.

   TBD: insert charts showing historical relative data usage patterns
   with error bars by time of day in consumer networks?

   Cross-ref vs. video quality by time of day in practice for some case
   study?  Not sure if there's a good way to capture a generalized
   insight here, but it seems worth making the point that demand
   projections can be used to help with e.g. power consumption with
   routing architectures that provide for modular scalability.

2.5.  Unpredictable Usage Profiles

   Although TCP/IP has been used with a number of widely used
   applications that have symmetric bandwidth requirements (similar
   bandwidth requirements in each direction between endpoints), many
   widely-used Internet applications operate in client-server roles,
   with asymmetric bandwidth requirements.  A common example might be an
   HTTP GET operation, where a client sends a relatively small HTTP GET
   request for a resource to an HTTP server, and often receives a
   significantly larger response carrying the requested resource.  When
   HTTP is commonly used to stream movie-length video, the ratio between
   response size and request size can become quite large.

   For this reason, operators may pay more attention to downstream
   bandwidth utilization when planning and managing capacity.  In
   addition, operators have been able to deploy access networks for end
   users using underlying technologies that are inherently asymetric,
   favoring downstream bandwidth (e.g.  ADSL, cellular technologies,
   most IEEE 802.11 variants), assuming that users will need less
   upstream bandwidth than downstream bandwidth.  This strategy usually
   works, except when it does not, because application bandwidth usage
   patterns have changed.

   One example of this type of change was when peer-to-peer file sharing
   applications gained popularity in the early 2000s.  To take one well-
   documented case ([RFC5594]), the Bittorrent application created
   "swarms" of hosts, uploading and downloading files to each other,



Holland, et al.         Expires 26 November 2021                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft             Media Streaming Ops                  May 2021


   rather than communicating with a server.  Bittorrent favored peers
   who uploaded as much as they downloaded, so that new Bittorrent users
   had an incentive to significantly increase their upstream bandwidth
   utilization.

   The combination of the large volume of "torrents" and the peer-to-
   peer characteristic of swarm transfers meant that end user hosts were
   suddenly uploading higher volumes of traffic to more destinations
   than was the case before Bittorrent.  This caused at least one large
   ISP to attempt to "throttle" these transfers, to mitigate the load
   that these hosts placed on their network.  These efforts were met by
   increased use of encryption in Bittorrent, similar to an arms race,
   and set off discussions about "Net Neutrality" and calls for
   regulatory action.

   Especially as end users increase use of video-based social networking
   applications, it will be helpful for access network providers to
   watch for increasing numbers of end users uploading significant
   amounts of content.

2.6.  Extremely Unpredictable Usage Profiles

   The causes of unpredictable usage described in Section 2.5 were more
   or less the result of human choices, but we were reminded during a
   post-IETF 107 meeting that humans are not always in control, and
   forces of nature can cause enormous fluctuations in traffic patterns.

   In his talk, Sanjay Mishra [Mishra] reported that after the CoViD-19
   pandemic broke out in early 2020,

   *  Comcast's streaming and web video consumption rose by 38%, with
      their reported peak traffic up 32% overall between March 1 to
      March 30,

   *  AT&T reported a 28% jump in core network traffic (single day in
      April, as compared to pre stay-at-home daily average traffic),
      with video accounting for nearly half of all mobile network
      traffic, while social networking and web browsing remained the
      highest percentage (almost a quarter each) of overall mobility
      traffic, and

   *  Verizon reported similar trends with video traffic up 36% over an
      average day (pre COVID-19)}.

   We note that other operators saw similar spikes during this time
   period.  Craig Labowitz [Labovitz] reported

   *  Weekday peak traffic increases over 45%-50% from pre-lockdown
      levels,

   *  A 30% increase in upstream traffic over their pre-pandemic levels,
      and

   *  A steady increase in the overall volume of DDoS traffic, with
      amounts exceeding the pre-pandemic levels by 40%. (He attributed
      this increase to the significant rise in gaming-related DDoS
      attacks ([LabovitzDDoS]), as gaming usage also increased.)

   Subsequently, the Inernet Architecture Board (IAB) held a COVID-19
   Network Impacts Workshop [IABcovid] in November 2020.  Given a larger
   number of reports and more time to reflect, the following
   observations from the draft workshop report are worth considering.

   *  Participants describing different types of networks reported
      different kinds of impacts, but all types of networks saw impacts.

   *  Mobile networks saw traffic reductions and residential networks
      saw significant increases.

   *  Reported traffic increases from ISPs and IXPs over just a few
      weeks were as big as the traffic growth over the course of a
      typical year, representing a 15-20% surge in growth to land at a
      new normal that was much higher than anticipated.

   *  At DE-CIX Frankfurt, the world's largest Internet Exchange Point
      in terms of data throughput, the year 2020 has seen the largest
      increase in peak traffic within a single year since the IXP was
      founded in 1995.

   *  The usage pattern changed significantly as work-from-home and
      videoconferencing usage peaked during normal work hours, which
      would have typically been off-peak hours with adults at work and
      children at school.  One might expect that the peak would have had
      more impact on networks if it had happened during typical evening
      peak hours for video streaming applications.

   *  The increase in daytime bandwidth consumption reflected both
      significant increases in "essential" applications such as
      videoconferencing and VPNs, and entertainment applications as
      people watched videos or played games.

   *  At the IXP-level, it was observed that port utilization increased.
      This phenomenon is mostly explained by a higher traffic demand
      from residential users.

3.  Adaptive Encoding, Adaptive Delivery, and Measurement Collection

4.  Adaptive Bitrate

4.1.  Overview

   Adaptive BitRate (ABR) is a sort of application-level response
   strategy in which the streaming client attempts to detect the
   available bandwidth of the network path by observing the successful
   application-layer download speed, then chooses a bitrate for each of
   the video, audio, subtitles and metadata (among the limited number of
   available options) that fits within that bandwidth, typically
   adjusting as changes in available bandwidth occur in the network or
   changes in capabilities occur during the playback (such as available
   memory, CPU, display size, etc.).

4.2.  Adaptive Encoding

   Media servers can provide media streams at various bitrates because
   the media has been encoded at various bitrates.  This is a so-called
   "ladder" of bitrates, that can be offered to media players as part of
   the manifest that describes the media being requested by the media
   player, so that the media player can select among the available
   bitrate choices.

   The media server may also choose to alter which bitrates are made
   available to players by adding or removing bitrate options from the
   ladder delivered to the player in subsequent manifests built and sent
   to the player.

   In this way both the player, through its selection of bitrate to
   request from the manifest, and the server, through its construction
   of the bitrates offered in the manifest, are able to affect network
   utilization.

4.3.  Adaptive Segmented Delivery

   ABR playback is commonly implemented by streaming clients using HLS
   [RFC8216] or DASH [DASH] to perform a reliable segmented delivery of
   media over HTTP.  Different implementations use different strategies
   [ABRSurvey], often relying on proprietary algorithms (called rate
   adaptation or bitrate selection algorithms) to perform available
   bandwidth estimation/prediction and the bitrate selection.

   Many server-player systems will do an initial probe or a very simple
   throughput speed test at the start of a video playback.  This is done
   to get a rough sense of the highest video bit rate in the ABR ladder
   that the network between the server and player will likely be able to



Holland, et al.         Expires 26 November 2021               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft             Media Streaming Ops                  May 2021


   provide under initial network conditions.  After the initial testing,
   clients tend to rely upon passive network observations and will make
   use of player side statistics such as buffer fill rates to monitor
   and respond to changing network conditions.

   The choice of bitrate occurs within the context of optimizing for
   some metric monitored by the client, such as highest achievable video
   quality or lowest chances for a rebuffering event (playback stall).

   This kind of bandwidth-measurement system can experience trouble in
   several ways that can be affected by networking design choices.
   Because adaptive application-level response strategies are typically
   using application-level protocols, these mechanisms are affected by
   transport-level protocol behaviors, and the application-level
   feedback loop is interacting with a transport-level feedback loop,
   ase described in Section 4.3.1 and Section 4.3.2.

4.3.1.  Idle Time between Segments

   When the bitrate selection is successfully chosen below the available
   capacity of the network path, the response to a segment request will
   typically complete in less absolute time than the duration of the
   requested segment.  The resulting idle time within the connection
   carrying the segments has a few surprising consequences:

   *  Mobile flow-bandwidth spectrum and timing mapping.

   *  TCP slow-start when restarting after idle requires multiple RTTs
      to re-establish a throughput at the network's available capacity.
      On high-RTT paths or with small enough segments, this can produce
      a falsely low application-visible measurement of the available
      network capacity.

   A detailed investigation of this phenomenon is available in
   [NOSSDAV12].

4.3.2.  Head-of-Line Blocking

   In the event of a lost packet on a TCP connection with SACK support
   (a common case for segmented delivery in practice), loss of a packet
   can provide a confusing bandwidth signal to the receiving
   application.  Because of the sliding window in TCP, many packets may
   be accepted by the receiver without being available to the
   application until the missing packet arrives.  Upon arrival of the
   one missing packet after retransmit, the receiver will suddenly get
   access to a lot of data at the same time.





Holland, et al.         Expires 26 November 2021               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft             Media Streaming Ops                  May 2021


   To a receiver measuring bytes received per unit time at the
   application layer, and interpreting it as an estimate of the
   available network bandwidth, this appears as a high jitter in the
   goodput measurement.

   Active Queue Management (AQM) systems such as PIE [RFC8033] or
   variants of RED [RFC2309] that induce early random loss under
   congestion can mitigate this by using ECN [RFC3168] where available.
   ECN provides a congestion signal and induce a similar backoff in
   flows that use Explicit Congestion Notification-capable transport,
   but by avoiding loss avoids inducing head-of-line blocking effects in
   TCP connections.

4.4.  Measurement Collection

   In addition to measurements media players use to guide their segment-
   by-segment adaptive streaming requests, streaming media providers may
   also rely on measurements collected from media players to provide
   analytics that can be used for decisions such as whether the adaptive
   encoding bitrates in use are the best ones to provide to media
   players, or whether current media content caching is providing the
   best experience for viewers.  [Conviva] is an example of one such
   such measurement collection system in use today.

4.5.  Unreliable Transport

   In contrast to segmented delivery, several applications use UDP or
   unreliable SCTP to deliver RTP or raw TS-formatted video.

   Under congestion and loss, this approach generally experiences more
   video artifacts with fewer delay or head-of-line blocking effects.
   Often one of the key goals is to reduce latency, to better support
   applications like videoconferencing, or for other live-action video
   with interactive components, such as some sporting events.

   Congestion avoidance strategies for this kind of deployment vary
   widely in practice, ranging from some streams that are entirely
   unresponsive to using feedback signaling to change encoder settings
   (as in [RFC5762]), or to use fewer enhancement layers (as in
   [RFC6190]), to proprietary methods for detecting quality of
   experience issues and cutting off video.

5.  Evolution of Transport Protocols and Transport Protocol Behaviors

   **Note to Reviewers^^ - this section includes some material that may
   be tutorial for some readers.  We can decide how to say that, if the
   tutorial material is worth keeping.  Spencer thought it was worth
   including, because it provides a contrast to the material on QUIC,
   which is significantly less tutorial, unless you participated in the
   QUIC working group.

   Because networking resources are shared between users, a good place
   to start our discussion is how contention between users, and
   mechanisms to resolve that contention in ways that are "fair" between
   users, impact streaming media users.  These topics are closely tied
   to transport protocol behaviors.

   As noted in Section 4, Adaptive Bitrate response strategies such as
   HLS [RFC8216] or DASH [DASH] are attempting to respond to changing
   path characteristics, and underlying transport protocols are also
   attempting to respond to changing path characteristics.

   For most of the history of the Internet, these transport protocols,
   described in Section 5.1 and Section 5.2, have had relatively
   consistent behaviors that have changed slowly, if at all, over time.
   Newly standardized transport protocols like QUIC
   [I-D.ietf-quic-transport] can behave differently from existing
   transport protocols, and these behaviors may evolve over time more
   rapidly than currently-used transport protocols.

   For this reason, we have included a description of how the path
   characteristics that streaming media providers may see are likely to
   evolve over time.

5.1.  UDP and Its Behavior

   For most of the history of the Internet, we have trusted UDP-based
   applications to limit their impact on other users.  One of the
   strategies used was to use UDP for simple query-response application
   protocols, such as DNS, which is often used to send a single-packet
   request to look up the IP address for a DNS name, and return a
   single-packet response containing the IP address.  Although it is
   possible to saturate a path between a DNS client and DNS server with
   DNS requests, in practice, that was rare enough that DNS included few
   mechanisms to resolve contention between DNS users and other users
   (whether they are also using DNS, or using other application
   protocols).






Holland, et al.         Expires 26 November 2021               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft             Media Streaming Ops                  May 2021


   In recent times, the usage of UDP-based applications that were not
   simple query-response protocols has grown substantially, and since
   UDP does not provide any feedback mechanism to senders to help limit
   impacts on other users, application-level protocols such as RTP
   [RFC3550] have been responsible for the decisions that TCP-based
   applications have delegated to TCP - what to send, how much to send,
   and when to send it.  So, the way some UDP-based applications
   interact with other users has changed.

   It's also worth pointing out that because UDP has no transport-layer
   feedback mechanisms, UDP-based applications that send and receive
   substantial amounts of information are expected to provide their own
   feedback mechanisms.  This expectation is most recently codified in
   Best Current Practice [RFC8085].

   RTP relies on RTCP Sender and Receiver Reports [RFC3550] as its own
   feedback mechanism, and even includes Circuit Breakers for Unicast
   RTP Sessions [RFC8083] for situations when normal RTP congestion
   control has not been able to react sufficiently to RTP flows sending
   at rates that result in sustained packet loss.

   The notion of "Circuit Breakers" has also been applied to other UDP
   applications in [RFC8084], such as tunneling packets over UDP that
   are potentially not congestion-controlled (for example,
   "Encapsulating MPLS in UDP", as described in [RFC7510]).  If
   streaming media is carried in tunnels encapsulated in UDP, these
   media streams may encounter "tripped circuit breakers", with
   resulting user-visible impacts.

5.2.  TCP and Its Behavior

   For most of the history of the Internet, we have trusted the TCP
   protocol to limit the impact of applications that sent a significant
   number of packets, in either or both directions, on other users.
   Although early versions of TCP were not particularly good at limiting
   this impact [RFC0793], the addition of Slow Start and Congestion
   Avoidance, as described in [RFC2001], were critical in allowing TCP-
   based applications to "use as much bandwidth as possible, but to
   avoid using more bandwidth than was possible".  Although dozens of
   RFCs have been written refining TCP decisions about what to send, how
   much to send, and when to send it, since 1988 [Jacobson-Karels] the
   signals available for TCP senders remained unchanged - end-to-end
   acknowledgments for packets that were successfully sent and received,
   and packet timeouts for packets that were not.

   The success of the largely TCP-based Internet is evidence that the
   mechanisms TCP used to achieve equilibrium quickly, at a point where
   TCP senders do not interfere with other TCP senders for sustained



Holland, et al.         Expires 26 November 2021               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft             Media Streaming Ops                  May 2021


   periods of time, have been largely successful.  The Internet
   continued to work even when the specific mechanisms used to reach
   equilibrium changed over time.  Because TCP provides a common tool to
   avoid contention, as some TCP-based applications like FTP were
   largely replaced by other TCP-based applications like HTTP, the
   transport behavior remained consistent.

   In recent times, the TCP goal of probing for available bandwidth, and
   "backing off" when a network path is saturated, has been supplanted
   by the goal of avoiding growing queues along network paths, which
   prevent TCP senders from reacting quickly when a network path is
   saturated.  Congestion control mechanisms such as COPA [COPA] and BBR
   [I-D.cardwell-iccrg-bbr-congestion-control] make these decisions
   based on measured path delays, assuming that if the measured path
   delay is increasing, the sender is injecting packets onto the network
   path faster than the receiver can accept them, so the sender should
   adjust its sending rate accordingly.

   Although TCP protocol behavior has changed over time, the common
   practice of implementing TCP as part of an operating system kernel
   has acted to limit how quickly TCP behavior can change.  Even with
   the widespread use of automated operating system update installation
   on many end-user systems, streaming media providers could have a
   reasonable expectation that they could understand TCP transport
   protocol behaviors, and that those behaviors would remain relatively
   stable in the short term.

5.3.  The QUIC Protocol and Its Behavior

   The QUIC protocol, developed from a proprietary protocol into an IETF
   standards-track protocol [I-D.ietf-quic-transport], turns many of the
   statements made in Section 5.1 and Section 5.2 on their heads.

   Although QUIC provides an alternative to the TCP and UDP transport
   protocols, QUIC is itself encapsulated in UDP.  As noted elsewhere in
   this document, the QUIC protocol encrypts almost all of its transport
   parameters, and all of its payload, so any intermediaries that
   network operators may be using to troubleshoot HTTP streaming media
   performance issues, perform analytics, or even intercept exchanges in
   current applications will not work for QUIC-based applications
   without making changes to their networks.

   While QUIC is designed as a general-purpose transport protocol, and
   can carry different application-layer protocols, the current
   standardized mapping is for HTTP/3 [I-D.ietf-quic-http], which
   describes how QUIC transport features are used for HTTP.  The
   convention is for HTTP/3 to run over UDP port 443 [Port443] but this
   is not a strict requirement.



Holland, et al.         Expires 26 November 2021               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft             Media Streaming Ops                  May 2021


   When HTTP/3 is encapsulated in QUIC, which is then encapsulated in
   UDP, streaming operators (and network operators) might see UDP
   traffic patterns that are similar to HTTP(S) over TCP.  Since earlier
   versions of HTTP(S) rely on TCP, UDP ports may be blocked for any
   port numbers that are not commonly used, such as UDP 53 for DNS.
   Even when UDP ports are not blocked and HTTP/3 can flow, streaming
   operators (and network operators) may severely rate-limit this
   traffic because they do not expect to see legitimate high-bandwidth
   traffic such as streaming media over the UDP ports that HTTP/3 is
   using.

   As noted in Section 5.2, there is increasing interest in transport
   protocol behaviors that responds to delay measurements, instead of
   responding to packet loss.  These behaviors may deliver improved user
   experience, but in some cases have not responded to sustained packet
   loss, which exhausts available buffers along the end-to-end path that
   may affect other users sharing that path.  The QUIC protocol provides
   a set of congestion control hooks that can be use for algorithm
   agility, and [I-D.ietf-quic-recovery] defines a basic algorithm with
   transport behavior that is roughly similar to TCP NewReno [RFC6582].
   However, QUIC senders can and do unilaterally chose to use different
   algorithms such as loss-based CUBIC [RFC8312], delay-based COPA or
   BBR, or even something completely different

   We do have experience with deploying new congestion controllers
   without melting the Internet (CUBIC is one example), but the point
   mentioned in Section 5.2 about TCP being implemented in operating
   system kernels is also different with QUIC.  Although QUIC can be
   implemented in operating system kernels, one of the design goals when
   this work was chartered was "QUIC is expected to support rapid,
   distributed development and testing of features", and to meet this
   expectation, many implementers have chosen to implement QUIC in user
   space, outside the operating system kernel, and to even distribute
   QUIC with applications.

   The decision to deploy a new version of QUIC is relatively
   uncontrolled, compared to other widely used transport protocols, and
   this can include new transport behaviors that appear without much
   notice except to the QUIC endpoints.  At IETF 105, Christian Huitema
   and Brian Trammell presented a talk on "Congestion Defense in Depth"
   [CDiD], that explored potential concerns about new QUIC congestion
   controllers being broadly deployed without the testing and
   instrumentation that current major content providers routinely
   include.  The sense of the room at IETF 105 was that the current
   major content providers understood what is at stake when they deploy
   new congestion controllers, but this presentation, and the related
   discussion in TSVAREA minutes from IETF 105 ([tsvarea-105], are still
   worth a look for new and rapidly growing content providers.

   It is worth considering that if TCP-based HTTP traffic and UDP-based
   HTTP/3 traffic are allowed to enter operator networks on roughly
   equal terms, questions of fairness and contention will be heavily
   dependent on interactions between the congestion controllers in use
   for TCP-base HTTP traffic and UDP-based HTTP/3 traffic.

   More broadly, [I-D.ietf-quic-manageability] discusses manageability
   of the QUIC transport protocol, focusing on the implications of
   QUIC's design and wire image on network operations involving QUIC
   traffic.  It discusses what network operators can consider in some
   detail.

6.  Streaming Encrypted Media

   "Encrypted Media" has at least three meanings:

   *  Media encrypted at the application layer, typically using some
      sort of Digital Rights Management (DRM) system, and typically
      retaining this encryption "at rest", when it is stored at senders
      and receivers,

   *  Media encrypted by the sender at the transport layer, and
      remaining encrypted until it reaches the ultimate media consumer
      (in this document, referred to as "end-to-end media encryption"),
      and

   *  Media encrypted by the sender at the transport layer, and
      remaining encrypted until it reaches some intermediary that is
      _not_ the ultimate media consumer, but has credentials allowing
      descryption of the media content.  This intermediary may examine
      and even transform the media content in some way, before
      forwarding re-encrypted media content (in this document referred
      to as "hop-by-hop media encryption")

   Both "hop-by-hop" and "end-to-end" encrypted transport may carry
   media that is, in addition, encrypted at the application layer.

   Each of these encryption strategies is intended to achieve a
   different goal.  For instance, application-level encryption may be
   used for business purposes, such as avoiding piracy or enforcing
   geographic restrictions on playback, while transport-layer encryption
   may be used to prevent media steam manipulation or to protect
   manifests.  This document does not take a position on whether those
   goals are "valid" (whatever that might mean).

   In this document, we will focus on media encrypted at the transport
   layer, whether encrypted "hop-by-hop" or "end-to-end".




Holland, et al.         Expires 26 November 2021               [Page 19]

Internet-Draft             Media Streaming Ops                  May 2021


   Both "End-to-End" and "Hop-by-Hop" media encryption have implications
   for streaming operators.

6.1.  General Considerations for Media Encryption

   The use of strong encryption does provide confidentiality for
   encrypted streaming media, from the sender to either an intermediary
   or the ultimate media consumer, and this does prevent Deep Packet
   Inspection by any intermediary that does not possess credentials
   allowing decryption.  However, even encrypted content streams may be
   vulnerable to traffic analysis.  An intermediary that can identify an
   encrypted media stream without decrypting it, may be able to
   "fingerprint" the encrypted media stream of known content, and then
   match the targeted media stream against the fingerprints of known
   content.  This protection can be lessened if a media provider is
   repeatedly encrypting the same content. [codaspy] is an example of
   what is possible when identifying HTTPS-protected videos over TCP
   transport, based either on the length of entire resources being
   transferred, or on characteristic packet patterns at the beginning of
   a resource being transferred.

   If traffic analysis is successful at identifying encrypted content
   and associating it with specific users, this breaks privacy as
   certainly as examining decrypted traffic.

   Because HTTPS has historically layered HTTP on top of TLS, which is
   in turn layered on top of TCP, intermediaries do have access to
   unencrypted TCP-level transport information, such as retransmissions,
   and some carriers exploited this information in attempts to improve
   transport-layer performance [RFC3135].  The most recent standardized
   version of HTTPS, HTTP/3 [I-D.ietf-quic-http], uses the QUIC protocol
   [I-D.ietf-quic-transport] as its transport layer.  QUIC relies only
   on the TLS 1.3 initial handshake for key exchange
   [I-D.ietf-quic-tls], and encrypts almost all transport parameters,
   with the exception of a few invariant fields.  In the QUIC short
   header, the only transport-level parameter which is sent "in the
   clear" is the destination connection ID [I-D.ietf-quic-invariants].
   For these reasons, HTTP/3 is significantly more "opaque" than HTTPS
   with HTTP/1 or HTTP/2.

6.2.  Considerations for "Hop-by-Hop" Media Encryption

   Although the IETF has put considerable emphasis on end-to-end
   streaming media encryption, there are still important use cases that
   require the insertion of intermediaries.

   There are a variety of ways to involve intermediaries, and some are
   much more intrusive than others.



Holland, et al.         Expires 26 November 2021               [Page 20]

Internet-Draft             Media Streaming Ops                  May 2021


   From a content provider's perspective, a number of considerations are
   in play.  The first question is likely whether the content provider
   intends that intermediaries are explicitly addressed from endpoints,
   or whether the content provider is willing to allow intermediaries to
   "intercept" streaming content transparently, with no awareness or
   permission from either endpoint.

   If a content provider does not actively work to avoid interception by
   intermediaries, the effect will be indistinguishable from
   "impersonation attacks", and endpoints cannot be assumed of any level
   of privacy.

   Assuming that a content provider does intend to allow intermediaries
   to participate in content streaming, and does intend to provide some
   level of privacy for endpoints, there are a number of possible tools,
   either already available or still being specified.  These include

   *  Server And Network assisted DASH [DASH-SAND] - this specification
      introduces explicit messaging between DASH clients and network
      elements or between various network elements for the purpose of
      improving the efficiency of streaming sessions by providing
      information about real-time operational characteristics of
      networks, servers, proxies, caches, CDNs, as well as DASH client's
      performance and status.

   *  "Double Encryption Procedures for the Secure Real-Time Transport
      Protocol (SRTP)" [RFC8723] - this specification provides a
      cryptographic transform for the Secure Real-time Transport
      Protocol that provides both hop-by-hop and end-to-end security
      guarantees.

   *  Secure Media Frames [SFRAME] - [RFC8723] is closely tied to SRTP,
      and this close association impeded widespread deployment, because
      it could not be used for the most common media content delivery
      mechanisms.  A more recent proposal, Secure Media Frames [SFRAME],
      also provides both hop-by-hop and end-to-end security guarantees,
      but can be used with other transport protocols beyond SRTP.

   If a content provider chooses not to involve intermediaries, this
   choice should be carefully considered.  As an example, if media
   manifests are encrypted end-to-end, network providers who had been
   able to lower offered quality and reduce on their networks will no
   longer be able to do that.  Some resources that might inform this
   consideration are in [RFC8825] (for WebRTC) and
   [I-D.ietf-quic-manageability] (for HTTP/3 and QUIC).

6.3.  Considerations for "End-to-End" Media Encryption

   "End-to-end" media encryption offers the potential of providing
   privacy for streaming media consumers, with the idea being that if an
   unauthorized intermediary can't decrypt streaming media, the
   intermediary can't use Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) to examine HTTP
   request and response headers and identify the media content being
   streamed.

   "End-to-end" media encryption became much more widespread in the
   years since [RFC7258] was issued, which identified pervasive
   monitoring as a much greater threat than previously appreciated.
