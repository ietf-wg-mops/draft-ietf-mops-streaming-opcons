When the segments are small, it is not more likely, either. I think what we are looking for is when the \"on\" duration is substantially longer than the \"off\" duration in the HTTP transaction. And that means, when the segment download time is substantially shorter than the inter-request time (typically the segment duration), which implies download speed is far greater than the segment's encoding bitrate. In that case, SSR will likely happen.",

This design was made consciously, as threat models are always use case specific, and we wanted to extract the media encryption itself, which is common to the video conferencing use case and the streaming use case for example. One hope is that this could be used in conjunction to existing DRM facilities (KMS, ...) to extend DRM (in browsers) to the real-time use case, and also to cover the entire media path and not just the delivery part like DRM does today.\r\n\r\nThe SFrame draft itself describes only the media encryption, while other documents, for now external to the SFrame working group, describe key exchange with MLS in the video conferencing use case (Cisco), or the RTP use case specifically (Part of AVTCORE scope). It is being designed to be compatible with SVC codecs extension for RTP (AVTCORE), and new proposal for WebRTC's ingest signalling (WISH).\r\n\r\nLet me know if you want some help in the matter, if only to point you to ongoing effort within IETF to get the big picture.",

LL-DASH).\r\n\r\nTraditional segmented delivery (HLS) allows segments to be downloaded with unlimited throughput. It's clear that if you can download 2s of media in 1s, then your network can handle double the throughput. Vice-versa, if it takes 3s to download 2s of media, then your network is struggling and you should switch down.\r\n\r\nBut when video is delivered as it is generated (LL-DASH), it is difficult to determine if your connection can handle a higher bitrate. 2s of media will be delivered in 2s even if your network can support a far higher throughput. The connection is application-limited and not congestion-limited.\r\n\r\nI haven't explored the public developments in this space, but it's difficult enough that Twitch has [sponsored an academic challenge](https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2020/01/15/twitch-invites-you-to-take-on-our-acm-mmsys-2020-grand-challenge/).

SVC codecs are one step further, since they achieve the same goal but with a single bitstream and have extra resilience, faster resolution shift, and native capacity for End-to-end encryption (DRM on steroids to protect both content and users) built in.\r\n\r\nI wrote a little something for non technical audience a few years back, and I m happy to give tech pointers to peer-reviewed papers and/or specifications if need be:\r\nhttp://webrtcbydralex.com/index.php/2019/04/06/webrtc-1-0-simulcast-vs-abr/",

In my opinion, it's why LLHLS opted to use smaller segments instead of streaming segments, at the cost of higher latency.\r\n\r\nLL-HLS uses parts (and these are not smaller segments) just like the chunks DASH-LL uses. However, LL-HLS still has a request/response for each of these parts unlike DASH-LL and that gives them the advantage of measuring the available bw a bit easier. But then, we already have developed ways to measure the available bw accurately in DASH-LL anyway.\r\n\r\nCheck the LoL+ algorithm we implemented (and also available of dash.js as of v3.2) at: https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js/wiki/Low-Latency-streaming\r\n\r\nYou might also find Twitch's evaluation interesting: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcXFVDotpy4 ",

To that effect, the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) who owns the Web Application Video Ecosystem (WAVE) project has published two important specifications. \r\n\r\n### CTA-2066: Streaming Quality of Experience Events, Properties and Metrics\r\n\r\nCTA-2066 specifies a set of media player events, properties, quality of experience (QoE) metrics and associated terminology for representing streaming media quality of experience across systems, media players and analytics vendors. While all these events, properties, metrics and associated terminology is used across a number of proprietary analytics and measurement solutions, they were used in slightly (or vastly) different ways that led to interoperability issues. CTA-2066 attempts to address this issue by defining a common terminology as well as how each metric should be computed for consistent reporting.  \r\n\r\n### CTA-5004: Common Media Client Data (CMCD)\r\n\r\nMany assumes that the CDNs have a holistic view into the health and performance of the streaming clients. However, this is not the case. The CDNs produce millions of log lines per second across hundreds of thousands of clients and they have no concept of a \"session\" as a client would have, so CDNs are decoupled from the metrics the clients generate and report. A CDN cannot tell which request belongs to which playback session, the duration of any media object, the bitrate, or whether any of the clients have stalled and are rebuffering or are about to stall and will rebuffer. The consequence of this decoupling is that a CDN cannot prioritize delivery for when the client needs it most, prefetch content, or trigger alerts when the network itself may be underperforming. One approach to couple the CDN to the playback sessions is for the clients to communicate standardized media-relevant information to the CDNs while they are fetching data. CTA-5004 was developed exactly for this purpose.  ",

These are being used increasingly for low latency delivery. The caching system is receiving the object in real-time while simultaneously forwarding it to the client. The object size is not known until the transmission is complete. Much of caching infrastructure failover and redundancy is predicated on knowing the size of the object you are transmitting. Distribution tiers have a hard time separating a gap in data from a failure of an upstream component. Setting appropriate time-outs becomes problematic.",

Most of what we've got in the current version of the draft is either well-understood or at least has consensus behind it (example - the material about QUIC isn't as mature as the material about TCP, but I think it's mature enough). I might think that the point of having the Synchronization workshop was that we don't have as much of a handle on that yet. Unless we do understand that well enough to provide input about potential new work in the IETF, maybe it IS worth holding off on this, and doing a separate document when we can be confident. \r\n\r\nBut this is definitely worth putting in front of the working group at IETF 111, no matter what the working group decides.

This introduces new challenges relative to less-restricted levels of latency requirements because this latency is the same scale as commonly observed end-to-end network latency variation (for example, due to effects such as bufferbloat, Wi-Fi error correction, or packet reordering). These effects can make it difficult to achieve this level of latency for the general case, and may require tradeoffs in relatively frequent user-visible media artifacts. However, for controlled environments or targeted networks that provide mitigations against such effects, this level of latency is potentially achievable with the right provisioning.",

Estimates\r\nput the total share of internet video traffic at 75% in 2019, expected\r\nto grow to 82% by 2022.  What's more, this estimate projects the\r\ngross volume of video traffic will more than double during this time,\r\nbased on a compound annual growth rate continuing at 34% (from Appendix\r\nD of {{CVNI}}).\r\n\r\nIn many contexts, video traffic can be handled transparently as\r\ngeneric application-level traffic.  However, as the volume of\r\nvideo traffic continues to grow, it's becoming increasingly\r\nimportant to consider the effects of network design decisions\r\non application-level performance, with considerations for\r\nthe impact on video delivery.\r\n\r\nThis document aims to provide a taxonomy of networking issues as\r\nthey relate to quality of experience in internet video delivery.\r\nThe focus is on capturing characteristics of video delivery that\r\nhave surprised network designers or transport experts without\r\nspecific video expertise, since these highlight key differences\r\nbetween common assumptions in existing networking documents and\r\nobservations of video delivery issues in practice.\r\n\r\nMaking specific recommendations for mitigating these issues\r\nis out of scope, though some existing mitigations are mentioned\r\nin passing.  The intent is to provide a point of reference for\r\nfuture solution proposals to use in describing how new\r\ntechnologies address or avoid these existing observed problems.\r\n\r\n#Bandwidth Provisioning\r\n\r\n##Scaling Requirements for Media Delivery {#scaling}\r\n\r\n###Video Bitrates\r\n\r\nVideo bit-rate selection depends on many variables.  Different\r\nproviders give different guidelines, but an equation that\r\napproximately matches the bandwidth requirement estimates\r\nfrom several video providers is given in {{MSOD}}:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\nKbps = (HEIGHT * WIDTH * FRAME_RATE) / (7 * 1024)\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nHeight and width are in pixels, and frame rate in frames per second.\r\nThe actual bit-rate required for a specific video will also depend on the\r\ncodec used and some other characteristics of the video itself, such\r\nas the frequency of high-detail motion, which may influence the\r\ncompressability of the content, but this equation provides a rough\r\nestimate.\r\n\r\nHere are a few common resolutions used for video content, with their\r\nminimum per-user bandwidth requirements according to this formula:\r\n\r\n| Name | Width x Height | Approximate Bit-rate for 60fps\r\n| -----+----------------+-------------------------------\r\n| DVD |  720 x 480 | 3 Mbps\r\n| 720p | 1280 x 720 | 8 Mbps\r\n| 1080p | 1920 x 1080 | 18 Mbps\r\n| 2160p (4k) | 3840 x 2160 | 70 Mbps\r\n\r\n###Virtual Reality Bitrates\r\n\r\nTBD: Reference and/or adapt content from expired\r\nwork-in-progress {{I-D.han-iccrg-arvr-transport-problem}}.\r\n\r\nThe punchline is that it starts at a bare minimum of 22 Mbps\r\nmean with a 130 Mbps peak rate, up to 3.3 Gbps mean with 38 Gbps\r\npeak for high-end technology.\r\n\r\n##Path Requirements\r\n\r\nThe bit-rate requirements in {{scaling}} are per end-user actively\r\nconsuming a media feed, so in the worst case, the bit-rate demands\r\ncan be multiplied by the number of simultaneous users to find the\r\nbandwidth requirements for a router on the delivery path with that\r\nnumber of users downstream.  For example, at a node with 10,000\r\ndownstream users simultaneously consuming video streams,\r\napproximately up to 180 Gbps would be necessary in order for all\r\nof them to get 1080p resolution at 60 fps.\r\n\r\nHowever, when there is some overlap in the feeds being consumed by\r\nend users, it is sometimes possible to reduce the bandwidth\r\nprovisioning requirements for the network by performing some kind\r\nof replication within the network.  This can be achieved via object\r\ncaching with delivery of replicated objects over individual\r\nconnections, and/or by packet-level replication using multicast.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that replication of popular content can be performed,\r\nbandwidth requirements at peering or ingest points can be reduced to\r\nas low as a per-feed requirement instead of a per-user requirement.\r\n\r\n##Caching Systems\r\n\r\nTBD: pros, cons, tradeoffs of caching designs at different locations within\r\nthe network?\r\n\r\nPeak vs. average provisioning, and effects on peering point congestion\r\nunder peak load?\r\n\r\nProvisioning issues for caching systems?\r\n\r\n##Predictable Usage Profiles\r\n\r\nTBD: insert charts showing historical relative data usage patterns with\r\nerror bars by time of day in consumer networks?\r\n\r\nCross-ref vs. video quality by time of day in practice for some case\r\nstudy?  Not sure if there's a good way to capture a generalized insight\r\nhere, but it seems worth making the point that demand projections can\r\nbe used to help with e.g. power consumption with routing architectures\r\nthat provide for modular scalability.\r\n\r\n##Unpredictable Usage Profiles\r\n\r\nAlthough TCP/IP has been used with a number of widely used applications that have symmetric bandwidth requirements (similar bandwidth requirements in each direction between endpoints), many widely-used Internet applications operate in client-server roles, with asymmetric bandwidth requirements. A common example might be an HTTP GET operation, where a client sends a relatively small HTTP GET request for a resource to an HTTP server, and often receives a significantly larger response carrying the requested resource. When HTTP is commonly used to stream movie-length video, the ratio between response size and request size can become quite large. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, operators may pay more attention to downstream bandwidth utilization when planning and managing capacity. In addition, operators have been able to deploy access networks for end users using underlying technologies that are inherently asymetric, favoring downstream bandwidth (e.g. ADSL, cellular technologies, most IEEE 802.11 variants), assuming that users will need less upstream bandwidth than downstream bandwidth. This strategy usually works, except when it does not, because application bandwidth usage patterns have changed. \r\n\r\nOne example of this type of change was when peer-to-peer file sharing applications gained popularity in the early 2000s. To take one well-documented case ({{RFC5594}}), the Bittorrent application created \"swarms\" of hosts, uploading and downloading files to each other, rather than communicating with a server. Bittorrent favored peers who uploaded as much as they downloaded, so that new Bittorrent users had an incentive to significantly increased their upstream bandwidth utilization. \r\n\r\nOne example of this type of change was when peer-to-peer file sharing applications gained popularity in the early 2000s. To take one well-documented case ({{RFC5594}}), the Bittorrent application created \"swarms\" of hosts, uploading and downloading files to each other, rather than communicating with a server. Bittorrent favored peers who uploaded as much as they downloaded, so that new Bittorrent users had an incentive to significantly increased their upstream bandwidth utilization. \r\n\r\nThe combination of the large volume of \"torrents\" and the peer-to-peer characteristic of swarm transfers meant that end user hosts were suddenly uploading higher volumes of traffic to more destinations than was the case before Bittorrent. This caused at least one large ISP to attempt to \"throttle\" these transfers, to mitigate the load that these hosts placed on their network. These efforts were met by increased use of encryption in Bittorrent, similar to an arms race, and set off discussions about \"Net Neutrality\" and calls for regulatory action.\r\n\r\nEspecially as end users increase use of video-based social networking applications, it will be helpful for access network providers to watch for applications that encourage end users to upload significant amounts of content. \r\n\r\n#Adaptive Bit Rate\r\n\r\n##Overview\r\n\r\nAdaptive Bit-Rate (ABR) is a sort of application-level congestion\r\nresponse strategy in which the receiving media player attempts to\r\ndetect the available bandwidth of the network path by experiment\r\nor by observing the successful application-layer download speed,\r\nthen chooses a video bitrate that fits within that bandwidth,\r\ntypically adjusting as changes in available bandwidth occur in\r\nthe network.\r\n\r\nThe choice of bit-rate occurs within the context of optimizing for\r\nsome metric monitored by the video player, such as highest achievable\r\nvideo quality, or lowest rate of expected rebuffering events.\r\n\r\n##Segmented Delivery\r\n\r\nABR strategies are commonly implemented by video players using HLS\r\n{{RFC8216}} or DASH {{DASH}} to perform a reliable segment delivery\r\nof video data over HTTP.  Different player implementations and\r\nreceiving devices use different strategies, often proprietary\r\nalgorithms, to perform the bit-rate selection and available\r\nbandwidth estimation.\r\n\r\nThis kind of bandwidth-detection system can experience trouble in\r\nseveral ways that can be affected by networking design choices.\r\n\r\n###Idle Time Between Segments\r\n\r\nWhen the bit-rate selection is successfully chosen below the\r\navailable capacity of the network path, the response to a\r\nsegment request will complete in less absolute time than the\r\nvideo bit-rate speed.\r\n\r\nThe resulting idle time within the connection carrying the\r\nsegments has a few surprising consequences:\r\n\r\n * Mobile flow-bandwidth spectrum and timing mapping.\r\n\r\n * TCP Slow-start when restarting after idle requires multiple\r\n   RTTs to re-establish a throughput at the network's available\r\n   capacity.  On high-RTT paths or with small enough segments,\r\n   this can produce a falsely low application-visible measurement\r\n   of the available network capacity.\r\n\r\n###Head of Line Blocking\r\n\r\nIn the event of a lost packet on a TCP connection with SACK\r\nsupport (a common case for segmented delivery in practice), loss\r\nof a packet can provide a confusing bandwidth signal to the\r\nreceiving application.  Because of the sliding window in TCP,\r\nmany packets may be accepted by the receiver without being available\r\nto the application until the missing packet arrives.  Upon arrival\r\nof the one missing packet after retransmit, the receiver will\r\nsuddenly get access to a lot of data at the same time.\r\n\r\nTo a receiver measuring bytes received per unit time at the\r\napplication layer, and interpreting it as an estimate of the\r\navailable network bandwidth, this appears as a high jitter in\r\nthe goodput measurement.\r\n\r\nActive Queue Management (AQM) systems such as PIE {{RFC8033}} or\r\nvariants of RED {{RFC2309}}} that induce early random loss under\r\ncongestion can mitigate this by using ECN {{RFC3168}} where\r\navailable.  ECN provides a congestion signal and induce a similar\r\nbackoff in flows that use Explicit Congestion Notification-capable\r\ntransport, but by avoiding loss avoids inducing head-of-line blocking\r\neffects in TCP connections.\r\n\r\n##Unreliable Transport\r\n\r\nIn contrast to segmented delivery, several applications use UDP or\r\nunreliable SCTP to deliver RTP or raw TS-formatted video.\r\n\r\nUnder congestion and loss, this approach generally experiences more\r\nvideo artifacts with fewer delay or head of line blocking effects.\r\nOften one of the key goals is to reduce latency, to better support\r\napplications like video conferencing, or for other live-action\r\nvideo with interactive components, such as some sporting events.\r\n\r\nCongestion avoidance strategies for this kind of deployment vary\r\nwidely in practice, ranging from some streams that are entirely\r\nunresponsive to using feedback signaling to change encoder settings\r\n(as in {{RFC5762}}), or to use fewer enhancement layers (as in\r\n{{RFC6190}}), to proprietary methods for detecting quality of\r\nexperience issues and cutting off video.\r\n\r\n# Doc History and Side Notes\r\n\r\nNote to RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication\r\n\r\nTBD: suggestion from mic at IETF 106 (Mark Nottingham): dive into\r\nthe different constraints coming from different parts of the network\r\nor distribution channels. (regarding questions about how to describe\r\nthe disconnect between demand vs. capacity, while keeping good archival\r\nvalue.)\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_k340xT2jM&t=13m\r\n\r\nTBD: suggestion from mic at IETF 106 (Dave Oran + Glenn Deen responding):\r\npre-placement for many use cases is useful--distinguish between live vs.\r\ncacheable.  \"People assume high-demand == live, but not always true\" with\r\npopular netflix example.\r\n\r\n(Glenn): something about latency requirements for cached vs. streaming on\r\nlive vs.  pre-recorded content, and breaking requirements into 2 separate\r\ncharts.  also: \"Standardized ladder\" for adaptive bit rate rates suggested,\r\ndeclined as out of scope.\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_k340xT2jM&t=14m15s\r\n\r\nTBD: suggestion at the mic from IETF 106 (Aaron Falk): include\r\nindustry standard metrics from citations, some standard scoping metrics\r\nmay be already defined.\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_k340xT2jM&t=19m15s\r\n\r\n#IANA Considerations\r\n\r\nThis document requires no actions from IANA.\r\n\r\n#Security Considerations\r\n\r\nThis document introduces no new security issues.\r\n\r\n--- back\r\n\r\n",

With DASH-LL and LL-HLS, people are now looking at 2-5 seconds of latency (so that is low latency). For latencies lower than 1s, at the ms level, cloud gaming for example, that is what ultra low latency nowadays means. FWIW, companies offering streaming solutions using WebRTC claim their solutions are ULL and others are only LL.",

              "body": "IMHO the ingest use case is important. When latency is important, this is the segment where RTMP seems to be the most used nowadays. Beyond RTMP, It s difficult to draw the line though. If we wanted to be more inclusive, SRT is being used (by people with a haivision encoder), RIST is being used, RTSP is being used (especially for surveillance camera), and even raw RTP (AWS kinetic), or webrtc (millicast.com).\r\n\r\nVery often the protocol choice seems to be dictated by the existing hardware.\r\n\r\nMost of the time, with the exception of RTSP/RTP/webrtc, it includes a transcoding step in the media path which adds latency. The added latency is at least one frame (33ms), but depends on the depth of the frame buffer, and is usually inconsequential unless you are aiming for real-time (gaming, ...) where your total glass to glass latency budget is usually 150~200 ms. A recent peer-reviewed study on comparison of encoders for real-time content touches on that point [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14165)\r\n\r\nI could not find an authoritative source on corresponding volumes, even though bitomovin 2020 report put them in that order: HLS > RTMP > webrtc. I believe this makes sense only if you take \"slow live\" (more than 10s) into account, and there HLS prevails, otherwise the consensus is that RTMP prevails.\r\n\r\nTo make supporting WebRTC ingest easier, especially for hardware encoders, there is an ongoing IETF effort and a proposed Draft. It's going through Dispatch this time around, so it s too early to put it in this document, but I wanted to bring it to the attention of the group, and it could be of interest for discussion in march, dispatch willing.\r\nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-murillo-whip/",

So I'll leave some time to raise objections (and maybe even ask the wg opinion tomorrow), but otherwise plan to open that issue shortly, unless someone has a better suggestion.",

Although dozens of RFCs have been written refining TCP decisions about what to send, how much to send, and when to send it, since 1988 {{Jacobson-Karels}} the signals available for TCP senders remained unchanged - end-to-end acknowledgments for packets that were successfully sent and received, and packet timeouts for packets that were not. \r\n```",

I think the discussion about that aspect of this document dates back to https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-jholland-mops-taxonomy-00, and I probably missed some of the discussion.

Not sure if this goes too far?\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n## Advertising\r\n\r\nFor many use cases advertising plays a critical role in the business decision to stream an event, so advertising often is included as part of streaming media over the internet.\r\nSome commonly used forms of advertising can introduce potential user experience issues for a media stream.\r\nThis section provides a very brief overview of a complex and evolving space, but a complete coverage of the potential issues is out of scope for this document.\r\n\r\nABR media can dynamically insert ads with either Client Side Ad Insertion (CSAI) or Server Side Ad Insertion (SSAI).\r\nIn CSAI, the ABR manifest will generally include links to an external ad server for some segments of the media stream, while in SSAI the server will remain the same during advertisements, but will include media segments that contain the advertising.\r\nIn SSAI, the media segments may or may not be sourced from an external ad server like with CSAI.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, especially with SSAI, advertising space in a stream is reserved for a specific advertiser and can be integrated with the video so that the segments share the same encoding properties such as bitrate, dynamic range, and resolution.\r\nHowever, in many cases ad servers integrate with a Supply Side Platform (SSP) that offers advertising space in real-time auctions via an Ad Exchange, with bids for the advertising space coming from Demand Side Platforms (DSPs) that collect money from advertisers for delivering the advertisements.\r\nMost such Ad Exchanges use application-level protocol specifications published by the Interactive Advertising Bureau {{IAB-ADS}}, an industry trade organization.\r\n\r\nThis ecosystem balances several competing objectives, and integrating with it naively can produce surprising user experience results.\r\nFor example, ad server provisioning and/or the bitrate of the ad segments might be different from that of the main video, either of which can sometimes result in video stalls.\r\nFor another example, since the inserted ads are often produced independently they might have a different base volume level than the main video, which can make for a jarring user experience.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this market historically has had incidents of ad fraud (misreporting of ad delivery to end users for financial gain).\r\nAs a mitigation for concerns driven by those incidents, some SSPs have required the use of players with features like reporting of ad delivery, or providing information that can be used for user tracking.\r\nSome of these and other measures have raised privacy concerns for end users.\r\n\r\nIn general this is a rapidly developing space with many considerations, and media streaming operators engaged in advertising may need to research these and other concerns to find solutions that meet their user experience, user privacy, and financial goals.\r\nFor further reading on mitigations, {{BAP}} has published some standards and best practices based on user experience research.\r\n\r\nIAB-ADS: iab.com\r\nBAP: https://www.betterads.org\r\n~~~",

              "body": "Not much or very specifically, but I'll give my own take:\r\nThere was a point when it was probably open to add another author that would take on a range of new issues and the various tasks involved in getting this doc to a publishable state, but that's probably a bit late by now, assuming nothing goes too terribly wrong.  The PR has a significant contribution for which I'm grateful, but I don't think it's quite the same as going into the author's list as it stands.\r\n\r\nBut with that said, it's definitely true that a few people have contributed at a significantly higher level than some of the others, and this is a good candidate for one of them--it tends to lean toward \"above and beyond\" to post several paragraphs of proposed draft text, as opposed to hand-waving at a general point for the authors to address from the mic line.  Although that latter is also a welcome kind of feedback, in some cases it's harder to turn into a value-add to the doc than proposed text is.\r\n\r\nI guess the relevant advice is Sections 4.10 and 4.11 from RFC 7322, and they seem to leave a wide latitude on how exactly to do it:\r\nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7322#section-4.10\r\n\r\nI haven't seen many RFCs that differentiate by level of effort in the Acknowledgements section or add a Contributor's section, but if a highlighted call-out of some sort would be meaningful there, we could try discussing the best way to put such a thing?  Or maybe you and he would rather have an offer of a beer with a personal thank-you next time we're in the same area, and go in the regular list of acknowledgements instead of the authors?  I'm basically aiming to land on nobody feeling slighted here while taking all the contributions that improve the doc.\r\n\r\nBut I think that summary is \"let's drop these particular lines, and open a new issue to get the acknowledgements right if that's needed\".",

Yes, to many, the answer could be just providing enough bandwidth for others, it could be a bit more complicated. If you have seen my recent ANRW talk, I refer to the \"QoS\" as the first camp (slide 5) and many efforts to date simply failed in that aspect.\r\n\r\nPaper: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3472305.3472886\r\nSlides: https://irtf.org/anrw/2021/slides-111-anrw-sessd-manus-manum-lavat-media-clients-and-servers-cooperating-with-common-media-clientserver-data-00.pdf\r\n\r\n",
